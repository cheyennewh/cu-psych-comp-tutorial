<h1>1) Why multilevel modeling?</h1>
<p>Multilevel modeling, also called ‘hierarchical’, or ‘mixed-effects’ modeling is an extrordinarly powerfull tool when we have data with a <em>nested</em> structure!</p>

<h2>Is multilevel modeling hard? Why is it worth my time?</h2>
<p>There are some challenges, but in R, constructing multilevel models follows a very similar syntax to non-nested models! While making modeling decisions can be difficult, actually running multilevel models in R is pretty intuitive!</p>
<p>In situations with nested data, I think multilevel modeling is almost always worth it because
* these models are powerful in accounting for variance resulting from nested structures in the data
* these models in many situations can help us reduce our uncertainty about population-level effects and robustly account for noisy data
* these models in many cases best match our intuitions about the true structure of the data</p>

<div id="what-are-some-examples-of-situations-in-which-multilevel-modeling-might-be-helpful" class="section level2">
<h2>What are some examples of situations in which multilevel modeling might be helpful?</h2>
<p>I always like to think about whether the data are <strong>nested</strong> when addressing this question. If the data have a nested, or hierarchical structure, then multilevel modeling is probably a good idea.</p>
<p>Some examples of data nesting:</p>
<ul>
<li>In a cognitive experiment, subjects each complete many trials of a task. Here <em>trials</em> are nested within <em>subjects</em></li>
<li>In a math intervention program, students in different classes each take a test. Here <em>students</em> are nested within <em>classes</em></li>
<li>We have county-level data on heart disease rates from 2017. Here we could nest <em>counties</em> within <em>states</em></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="why-not-just-compute-participant-level-summaries-and-do-stats-on-these-arent-these-summaries-more-stable-and-easier-to-work-with" class="section level2">
<h2>Why not just compute participant-level summaries, and do stats on these? Aren’t these summaries more stable AND easier to work with?</h2>
<ul>
<li>While this can be a good initial approach, we <em>lose information</em> about the data when we compute a summary of any kind</li>
<li>While participant-level summaries, such as the mean score across 20 trials within a participant (in the first example above), are indeed more stable than individual trials themselves, this approach assumes that all participants are equally variable and thus should all contribute equally to the results</li>
<li>Especially when some participants have more trials than others, we might want to take into account that some participants’ individual estimates are <em>more reliable</em> than others</li>
<li>Taking the summary approach can cause us to misinterpret our certainty about effects AND miss real trends in the data.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="ive-heard-about-partial-pooling-in-multilevel-models-what-is-this-why-would-i-want-to-change-my-estimates-of-each-participant-from-their-true-data" class="section level2">
<h2>I’ve heard about partial pooling in multilevel models, what is this? Why would I want to change my estimates of each participant from their TRUE data?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Partial pooling is a process by which population-level and individual-level effects are estimated at the same time, and each participants’ estimated effect reflects a weighted combination of their own data and the population average. Becuase this structure considers subjects to be drawn from a population distribution, subjects further away from the population average are ‘pooled’ in.</li>
<li>While changing estimates of each participant from the raw data seems scary, if we consider that data usually contain noise, then this process can be viewed as <em>adjusting noisy estimates</em> on the subject level based on what we know about group level trends. If subjects have very precise data, and lots of it, their estimates will be adjusted less. If subjects have less data or more uncertain data, they will be pooled more.</li>
<li>Pooling can also help models become much more robust to outliers, and is especially helpful when different participants have different amounts of data. We’ll see a demo of this soon.</li>
</ul>

<div id="multilevel-regression-model-syntax" class="section level1">
<h1>2) Multilevel regression model syntax!</h1>
<p>Here is the general syntax for modeling in two popular packages, <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lme4/index.html" target="_blank">lme4</a> and <a href="https://github.com/paul-buerkner/brms" target="_blank">brms</a>. In general, this syntax looks very similar to the <code>lm()</code> syntax in R.</p>
<p>In multilevel regression models, we can let different groups (lets say subjects here) have their own <em>intercepts</em> or <em>slopes</em> or both.</p>
<div id="varying-intercepts" class="section level3">
<h3>Varying Intercepts:</h3>
<p>The syntax for letting each subject have their own intercept would be:</p>
<p><code>outome ~ predictor + (1|subject)</code></p>
<p>This is basically the same syntax as an OLS regression such as <code>lm(outcome ~ predictor)</code>, except we add the second term to let each subject have their own intercept for this given outcome.</p>
</div>
<div id="varying-slopes" class="section level3">
<h3>Varying Slopes:</h3>
<p>The syntax for letting each subject have their own intercept AND slope would be:</p>
<p><code>outome ~ predictor + (predictor|subject)</code></p>
<p>This means that when we are estimating the effect of the predictor on the outcome, we also allow each subject to have their own (simultaneously estimated) effect for the predictor on the outcome, as well as the intercept.</p>

<h1>3) Setting up the data</h1>
<p>We’ll use a simulated dataset for this vignette, so you don’t need to worry about any dependencies involving datasets you don’t have access to while you’re following along. This dataset was created by Monica Thieu initially in the Tidyguide tutorials, so we’ll use a very similar one here. If you have <code>tidyverse</code> loaded, all this code should run if you try to run it in your R console.</p>

<p>So, we can see from this example that the use of the multilevel model helps us recover this true effect of age whereas a model based on subject-level summaries is not as robust to outliers.</p>
</div>
<div id="is-this-just-because-of-outliers" class="section level2">
<h2>Is this <em>just</em> because of outliers?</h2>
<p>This is a particularly clean example where we KNOW that one subject is an outlier who was not doing the experiment the same way. Usually we don’t have that luxury, so multilevel modeling gives us a big advantage in being able to include all the data and allowing the model to estimate effects in a manner robust to potential outliers.</p>
<p>This is more of a philosophical point, but in general it can be very hard (and sometimes a confound) to decide when to exclude subjects or trials. We can define cutoffs, but we may still get outliers within these cutoffs. Even with reasonable outlier exclusion rates, we often see that multilevel models help to model the data in a manner more robust to outliers.</p>

</div>
<div id="what-about-the-bayesian-stuff" class="section level1">
<h1>5) What about the Bayesian stuff?</h1>
<p>The Bayesian aspect of multilevel modeling was implicit in much of this tutorial today, but we didn’t really focus on it. However, Bayesian software like brms lends itself particuarly well to multilevel modeling frameworks where there are many parameters and optimization is complex – bayesian approaches will still give us models that don’t fit well if the data are too sparse (and we don’t set regularizing priors) but they won’t fail to converge in the same way maximum likelihood models do.</p>
<p>We haven’t talked much about the difference in approach when using Bayesian as opposed to frequentist modeling today – more on that soon!</p>
