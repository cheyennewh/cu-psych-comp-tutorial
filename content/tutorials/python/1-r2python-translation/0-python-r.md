# A few quick points:

- Among scientific computing languages the best language for you is the one that *you* find best fits your projects
- We **really** encourage the use of either R and Python for research computing  for several reasons
    - R and Python are open source! We believe in making scientific computing as accessible to as many people as possible
    - R and Python both have TONS of tools for research computing, lots of documentation, and huge support communities around the world

# Neither language is 'better' than the other

### Depending on your application, one might be better suited

#### R Strengths
- Statistical Programming Language
- Visualization(ggplot)
- Web apps (shiny)
- Statistical Model Interpretation 

#### Python Strengths
- All purpose programming language
- Neuroimaging
- Task design (psychopy, pygame)
- Machine learning (sklearn, tensorflow, keras)
- Many programs/web tools have great python APIs
- Web scraping

# For research, helpful to know some of both!
