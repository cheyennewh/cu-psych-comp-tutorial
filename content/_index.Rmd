## Individual Scientific Computing Support

---

CU psychology graduate students can stop by to chat about using computing tools at any stage of the research process. Use cases include, but are not limited to:

- Conducting pre-study power analysis
- Setting up tools for administering tasks in-person and online
- Cleaning and analyzing data
- Preparing presentations and manuscripts

During the Fall 2020 semester, the [graduate methods support advisors](/who/) will be holding office hours by appointment. To schedule a time that works well for you, or for email support, please contact [psych-methods-support@columbia.edu](mailto:psych-methods-support@columbia.edu){target="_blank"}.

## Scientific Computing Workshop

---

This is our core introductory scientfic computing syllabus. The materials here are designed to be suitable for learners with little to no prior programming experience.

## Additional Instructional Materials

---

Many of these materials were originally prepared as presentations for Columbia Psychology R users, but are also designed to be stand-alone tutorials that you can read through and learn from remotely. These materials span a wider range of learner skill levels, and assume basic experience with scientific computing.

### Accelerated `ggplot2`
