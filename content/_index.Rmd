# Welcome!

## Individual Scientific Computing Support

---

Columbia University psychology graduate students can stop by to chat about using computing tools at any stage of the research process. Use cases include, but are not limited to:

- Conducting pre-study power analysis
- Setting up tools for administering tasks in-person and online
- Cleaning and analyzing data
- Preparing presentations and manuscripts

During the Spring 2021 semester, the [graduate methods support advisors](/who/) will be holding office hours by appointment. To schedule a time that works well for you, or for email support, please contact [psych-methods-support@columbia.edu](mailto:psych-methods-support@columbia.edu){target="_blank"}.

## Ongoing Meetings and Workshops

---

Our next workshop, *Creating Websites in Github and R*, is scheduled for January 27th, 2021, at 4 pm. For more information, visit the [Meetings](/meetings/) page.

## Annual Scientific Computing Workshop

## Additional Instructional Materials

---

Many of these materials were originally prepared as presentations for Columbia Psychology R users, but are also designed to be stand-alone tutorials that you can read through and learn from remotely. These materials span a wider range of learner skill levels, and assume basic experience with scientific computing.
