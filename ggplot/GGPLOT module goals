GGPLOT:
•	Learning Goals
o	Students will be able to install and load ggplot2
o	Students will be able to understand and implement the basic ggplot syntax to make the following basic plots
•	Scatter plot
•	Dots, organized by a grouping factor
•	Means/Confidence Intervals of groups
•	Fit a linear model
o	Students will be able to use basic features of color, axis labels, and faceting
o	Students will feel encouraged and empowered to look up other tools for plotting in ggplot to plot more complex things and customize their plots more

Idea for module

Demonstrate live-coding on one data set and IN SESSION, ask students to write their own code from scratch to plot basically the same things on a second data set that is formatted in the same way structurally (but with different variable names)


For example:
•	Live code and explain a scatter plot for students using MTcars with 2 continuous variables in that dataset
•	Then, give the students a dataset with 2 continuous variables (no missing data) and ask them to generate a scatter plot with 1 variable on the x axis and one on the y axis

Scatter Plots/Basic GGplot syntax
•	Demonstrate on 2 continous mtcars variables
•	On student dataset, ask them to do the same with 2 variables

Plots comparing 2 groups
•	Demonstrate on mtcars again
