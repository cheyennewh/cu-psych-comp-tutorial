Things we need for Monday:
  -Description of project before class (a syllabus)
  -Handout to give to people in class 
      -The handout will mostly be QUESTIONS and THINGS TO FOCUS ON about our LEARNING GOALS
        i.e. -- what material should we add? what should we take out?
        COLLECT THE HANDOUT AT THE END
  -For each module
      -Script for live coding part
      -Rmd for 'challenge'
      
 Presentation Will Be
    -What our course is?
    -Learning goals for the course
        -We want people USE R
        -But we also want them to learn R tools
        -Balancing this is a key thing
    -Show them the syllabus and modules
        -Includes the live coding parts and the challenges
        -How we plan to achieve our goals
    -Discuss dificulties (challenges) in making the course
        -discuss the handout basically -- 'warm calling' -- what people have written down can scaffold the discussion
 
 
 Ellen
    -make syllabus handout
 
 Everyone
    -make questions handout
    -finish your thing, edit your thing
        
    
        
ALSO WE SHOULD PUBLICIZE  -- MAKE A SURVEY TO FIGURE OUT WHEN WE'RE DOING THE CLASS AND WHO IS DOING THAT



GOOGLE DOC:
Ideas 
Swirl practice at home 
In class activities 
Out of class homework
Make it tractable! 
Use github, scripts, R markdown 


MODULES
WHY R 
How to get started with R and R studio and packages
How to get started with programming - show Swirl 
Reproducibility!
Best data practices
R markdown
Convenience - saves time in long run
Makes beautiful figures 
Data tidying
statistical flexibility
OPTIONAL PROGRAMMING BASICS
What is a data type 
What’s a dataframe, vector, indexing
Loops 
Conditionals
Point them to swirl’s programming tutorials onlne 
Preparing data for analysis in R
structural manipulation - wide/long
Reading in data
If you currently use X, here is how you can get data into X
Quality checks - headers
Grep for pattern matching! 
Always set strings as factors = F
Column names
Subsetting (filtering) for data
How to save this stuff for later! (reproducibility)
At the end: how to go further with this topic! (Travis’ github on tidyverse)
Descriptives
Descriptive plots - BASIC plots
Histograms
Basic plots 
Interaction plots  - niall’s plots
How to detect outliers
Built in plot tools


5. How to make graphs 
Introduce GGplot
All the magic of ggplot
How to save your graphs for your poster
At the end: wrap up, how to go further with this topic!
6. Stats 
Models (t-tests, regression, interactions, anova post-hoc lsmeans)
Diagnostic tools
Plotting model results
Effect plots
Partial residuals
Co-plots
Model comparisons
Add interaction plots! 
7. Future directions
Bayesian and stan
Mixed-effects models
Post-hoc tests and packages
Mediation, Lavaan - factor analysis and SEM
Sending your scripts through github! 
R can be used for manuscript writing too! (like latec but for R) 
Neuropointilist 
Github
Dynamic plots

 	[[Propose realistic research questions and how to solve those problems with R]]

For each module
Teaching goal
Tutorial  - walking through scripts
Planned activity - 
Incomplete R markdown with scaffolding and chunks 
But forces them to write their own code 
Knit R key on real results.
List of outside activities / resources that they can do
Take home output that can be a reference for them in the future
Put it on github

What to do about different experience levels?
Activities in class
Work in Pairs, put experienced people with non-experienced people
Mixing up the pairs for every class 
What about people without coding experience? 
Advise them to use a lot of swirl ! 

Do interviews with non-R users
Why don’t you use R 
What do you need to start using R 
How can we help you do that

For the final class presentations:
1 page summary 
1 page handout during the presentation

IDEAS FROM INTERVIEWS:
Problem sets: How well do you Generalize what you just learned to a new thing.
Creating R functions: future directions
How much programming ? 
loops , conditionals, if-statements
