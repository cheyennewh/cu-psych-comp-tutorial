      <description>Welcome to the CU Psychology Scientific Computing workshop!
Programming is telling a computer to do some action to some input info to get output info that you want. When it comes to working with data in R, programming is how we tell R to load data, process it, plot it, fit models to it, and so on (everything!).
In this first section of our tutorial, we will learn about this info that goes in and out, as well as the actions that transform info into what we want.</description>

      <description>Welcome (back) to the CU Psychology Scientific Computing Workshop! As a reminder, the documents for the introduction to programming cover the following:
Finding your way around RStudio Variables, data types, vectors this document! Coding strategy, relational &amp;amp; logical operators  Variables  a variable is how we store information in a way that the computer can operate on it has a value: the info itself and a name: the cue by which we call upon the info to the computer  If you think about how variables like x and y are used in algebra, calculus, etc, that can be a useful way to conceptualize them.</description>

Finding your way around RStudio Variables, data types, vectors Coding strategy, relational &amp;amp; logical operators this document!  Now that you know (some of) what kinds of things R can manipulate, we will get into actually manipulating things!
Pseudocode This is so important to do before you write a single line of code.</description>
