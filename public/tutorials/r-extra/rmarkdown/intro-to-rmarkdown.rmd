```{r setup, include = FALSE}
# If you haven't yet, install the knitr package
# install.packages('knitr')

# Load libraries (I recommend loading all libraries upfront here)
library(knitr) # Required to knit RMarkdown files to produce final output document
library(ggplot2) # Required for plots included in this file

# More on this later, but the following kinds of knitr functions allow you to set knitting and chunk options upfront, which can be really useful when creating an R Markdown document
# knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
# knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = normalizePath('../'))
```

## Links to Files

The files for all tutorials can be downloaded from [the Columbia Psychology Scientific Computing GitHub page](https://github.com/cu-psych-computing/cu-psych-comp-tutorial){target="_blank"}. This particular file is located here: `/content/tutorials/r-extra/rmarkdown/intro-to-rmarkdown.rmd`.

## Getting started

To work with R Markdown, if necessary:

* Install [R](http://www.r-project.org/){target="_blank"}
* Install the latest version of [RStudio](http://rstudio.org/download/){target="_blank"}
* Install the latest version of the `knitr` package: `install.packages("knitr")`

If you're looking for a quick reference to R Markdown formatting, I strongly suggest you check out **[this helpful cheat sheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/rmarkdown-cheatsheet-2.0.pdf){target="_blank"}**!

# R Markdown formatting

In R Markdown, you can type normally as you would in a simple text document. This text can be interspersed with R code in what are called **chunks**. The ability to combine text and R code means that you can develop papers, manuscripts, presentations, and web pages (and more!) within a single document.

In order to see the code used to generate the formatting you'll see in the output document, we recommend you open to R Markdown (.Rmd) file as well as the final outputted PDF.

## Text formatting

You can *italicize* text by placing it inside of a single set of *asterisks* (`*`) or _underscores_ (`_`).

You can **bold** text by placing it inside of a double set of **asterisks** (`**`) or __underscores__(`__`).

Headers are created by starting a line with a specific number of pound or hash signs (`#`) that corresponds with the level of your header. For example:

# First-level header

## Second-level header

### Third-level header

#### Fourth-level header

##### Fifth-level header

## Lists

An unordered list (with bullet points) can be created by typing an asterisk and space (`* `) at the beginning of each line. Second-level sub-bullets can be created by typing tab *twice* and then typing a hyphen and a space (`    - `) at the beginning of each line. (I think on some computers sub-bullets may work if you type tab once, but it doesn't on my Mac!)

* Bullet 1
    + Sub-bullet 1
    + Sub-bullet 2
* Bullet 2
* Bullet 3

Please note: You'll need to *leave a blank line in your .Rmd file before the first bullet* or it won't output properly.

An ordered list (with numbers) can be created by typing a number, period, and space (e.g., `1. `) at the beginning of each line. Second-level sub-bullets can be created by typing tab *twice* and then typing "i", a right parenthesis, and a space (`    i) `) at the beginning of each line. (With each new line, you'll increase your "i"s as this is written in lowercase Roman numerals.)

1. Number 1
    i) Sub-bullet 1
    ii) Sub-bullet 2
2. Number 2
3. Number 3

## Equations

You can add equations to your R Markdown file by including them either between single dollar signs (for inline equations within your text) or double dollar signs (for a separate equation section below your text--often used to highlight formulas in papers). This is based on something called LaTeX notation.

Here is an example of an inline equation: $y_i = \alpha + \beta x_i + e_i$.

Here is a displayed formula:

$$\frac{1}{1+\exp(-x)}$$

## Hyperlinks

You can add a hyperlink by typing the text you'd like to link in brackets followed by the URL in parentheses *with no space between them*. [Here is an example](http://psychology.columbia.edu).

## Images

The code to include an image is similar to that for a hyperlink. You'll type an exlamation point, followed by the image caption in brackets, followed by the image location (either a URL or a path to the image's location on your computer) with no spaces between them. The image here is a bit large, so you'll see that RMarkdown pushed it to the next page in the knitted PDF document.

## Quotes

Quotes can be included by typing a greater-than sign and space at the beginning of each line (`> `).

> To be, or not to be, that is the question:
> Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
> The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune...

## Tables

Basic tables can be included using the following notation:

A  | B | C
--- | --- | ---
1  | Male | Blue
2  | Female | Pink

You can also include tables within code chunks, which will be illustrated in the next section.

# Code

## Code chunks

Most of the time, you'll use code chunks within R Markdown to run your code. Here is an example code chunk. (I've also created some dummy data here we'll use to demonstrate functions in subsequent code chunks.)

    ```{r}
    x <- c(1, 2, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 7, 9, 9)
    y <- 1:10
    df <- data.frame(x, y)
    x
    ```

To insert an R code chunk, you can type it manually or use the shortcut key (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>Alt</kbd>-<kbd>I</kbd> on PC;  <kbd>Cmd</kbd>-<kbd>Option</kbd>-<kbd>I</kbd> on Mac). This will produce the following code chunk:

    ```{r}
    
    ```

## Inline code

Inline code can be included by placing your code in and starting it with `r` and a space. (If you're viewing this in the PDF, see the .Rmd file for the code.) Inline code can be a really helpful way to pull out a datapoint and include it in your text. For example, here is the second value in our vector `x` : `r x[2]`.

## Tables (from code chunks)

You can create a table of a dataframe by placing the dataframe name within the `kable()` function.

```{r kable}
kable(df)
```

## Plots

Images generated by `knitr` are saved in a figures folder.

### Simple plots

Here is a basic plot using base-R graphics.

```{r simpleplot}
hist(x)
```

### `ggplot2` plots

`ggplot2` plots work as well:

```{r ggplot2}
ggplot(data = df, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point()
```

## Code chunk options

There are a wide range of code chunk options, which you can find listed in **[this helpful cheat sheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/rmarkdown-cheatsheet-2.0.pdf){target="_blank"}**. We highlight some of the most common here.

### `eval`: Evaluate the code in the chunk (or not)

You can tell R not to evaluate (i.e., run) the code in a particular chunk by inserting `eval = FALSE` at the beginning of your code chunk.

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    # We included the eval = FALSE option at the beginning of this chunk
    y <- 0
    ```

    ```{r}
    # We can check here and see that the change in the previous chunk was not made to y
    # because the code wasn't evaluated.
    y
    ```

### `cache`: Save a copy of your analysis (or not)

You can cache the results of your analyses if the analyses take a long time to run. If you insert `cache = TRUE` at the beginning of your code chunk, the analysis will run in full the first time you knit the file; in future knits, the code will not be re-run.

If you want to re-run cached code chunks, just [delete the contents of the `cache` folder](http://stackoverflow.com/a/10629121/180892){target="_blank"}.

    ```{r, cache = TRUE}
    for (i in 1:5000) {
        lm((i+1)~i)
    }
    ```

### `echo`: Show vs. hide command input

The `echo = FALSE` code hides the code within the code chunk within your output file but still runs the code. `results = 'asis'` here formats the output to match your document format (i.e., *not* to look like code output in the Courier font).

```{r dotpointprint, echo = FALSE, results = 'asis'}
cat("Here are some points within our `y` vector\n\n")
cat(paste("* The value of y[", 1:3, "] is ", y[1:3], sep="", collapse="\n"))
```

### `fig.width` and `fig.height`: Adjust your figure size

The following is an example of a smaller figure using `fig.width` and `fig.height` options.

    ```{r, fig.width=3, fig.height=3}
    plot(x)
    ```

```{r smallplot, fig.width=3, fig.height=3}
plot(x)
```

# R Markdown file types

There are a wide range of files you can create using R Markdown, but the options you'll probably use most commonly are a PDF, Word document, and HTML file. To change the output file type, change the `output:` line in your .Rmd header based on your desired file type:

* PDF: `pdf_document`
* Word: `word_document`
* HTML: `html_document`
