# Section starter

Niall sez:

--

**Over many theoretical repeated runs of a study, N% of the N% confidence intervals for all runs of the study are expected to overlap with the true parameter.**

--

A single point estimate of the confidence interval does not reflect an N% probability that the true parameter lies within that interval.

# Analytical vs numerical error intervals

.pull-left[

- calculated _exactly_ with formulas
- computationally _fast_
- wholly reliant on distributional assumptions
- conservative _(smaller)_ estimate of the true error

]

.pull-right[

- calculated _approximately_ by resampling
- computationally _slower_
- less reliant on distributional assumptions
- liberal _(larger)_ estimate of the true error
