    "**Locomotion:**   This measures a form of \"regulatory mode,\" and is a personality measure related to goal-directed behavior. High-locomotion people favor taking action over waiting for opportunities to present themselves.  \n",
    "**Assessment:** This is also a form of \"regulatory mode.\" High-assessment people place a high value on close observation, data collection, and critical thinking. Importantly, locomotion and assessment are designed to be uncorrelated, so someone can have low scores in both (and be hesitant and inattentive) or high scores in both (and be prone to action and hypervigilant).  \n",

    "**AcademAchieve:** This is a measure of academic achievement using the 20-point scale that is thenorm in Sweden. Thus, this can be thought of as analogous to a GPA."
