# this dataset examines the relationship between multitasking and working memory.
# original paper by Uncapher et al. 2016:  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4733435/pdf/nihms712443.pdf

# open the data from csv 
df <- read.csv("uncapher_2016_one_condition_dataset.csv")
```

## 1. what is the mean, range, and standard deviation False error rate?
 high multitaskers and low multitaskers?
```{r}

df %>% 
group_by(groupStatus) %>%
  summarize( mean=mean(faRate), 
             sd = sd(faRate), 
             min=min(faRate), 
             max=max(faRate))


```

# need to add.
