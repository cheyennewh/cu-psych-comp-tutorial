# cu-psych-r-tutorial
An intro to R for psychology-oriented users, created and maintained by students of the Columbia University psychology department.

Welcome! Here, please find a series of written materials you can use as lessons/references to build R fundamentals (for new R users), and perhaps find something handy you didn't know about before (older R souls).
