## Streamline your research process {.build}

Once you have some data, you can use R for every step of your research.  

Cleaning, organizing and combining data from multiple sources  

Calculations and data transformations  

Statistical Analysis  

Graphing  

Reports, papers, and presentations  

I made this slide show in R!  

## Reproducibility {.build}

Using scripts provides you with an explicit written record of everything you did with your data.  

Helps you remember what you did, and helps collaborators understand your work.  

Share full analysis with reviewers or other colleagues who might want to replicate or expand on your work.   

## Flexibility {.build}

Data can easily be split, reformatted, rearranged and combined for whatever analysis you need to do.  

No need to edit or alter original raw data.  

New packages are being created by users all the time.  

## R Community {.build}

Lots of people use R  

Many online statistic tutorials are written in R,  
and textbooks and classes are increasingly incorporating R code  

Common language for collaboration  

## It's free!

Free stuff is good.

# Why this class?

## Goals {.build}

Introduce the basics of programming in R, and demonstrate some simple tools and skills.  

Demonstrate strategies for solving R problems you may encounter in the future.    

Encourage you to start (or continue) using R for your research.  

Grow R community within the psychology department (or other departments!).

Introduce good research practices that you can implement even if you choose not to use R.

## Resources {.build}

All of the course materials are on our Github:

## Disclaimers {.build}

In this tutorial, you will not  
- Master R by the end of tomorrow  
- Actually learn statistics  

R can be overwhelming, even if you're not new to programming, because there are many ways to do any one thing.  

We have tried to focus on 1 way of doing each thing, but that doesn't mean other ways that you know or discover are wrong - they might even be better!
